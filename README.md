# Paul's Ethernaut Solutions 👨‍🚀

Hi. <br>
__[Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/)__ is an interactive CtF (Capture the Flag) web-based puzzle game which educates on common Solidity/EVM security exploits and how to tame them.

You might want to take a dive into this repository if you got stuck in one of the challenges OR if you want to compare your solution with mine - because a cool thing with these challenges is that there's always >1 solution to the problem!

The repo contains Solidity code with solutions (when it's applicable) and Foundry tests.

## Disclaimer
Obviously all the code is provided on purely educational and demonstrational grounds. Do not use any of this code in production, as the security guarantees are none.
